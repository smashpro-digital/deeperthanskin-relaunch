# deeperthanskin-relaunch

A premium relaunch landing page for **Deeper Than Skin** as the brand transitions away from Shopify and returns with a **wellness-first focus**: internal health products plus a curated return of top-selling skincare essentials.

This repo is designed to be deployed via **GitHub Pages** and intentionally showcases modern digital UX polish (responsive layout, subtle motion, countdown, and email capture).
