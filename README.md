A premium relaunch landing page for **Deeper Than Skin**, created to support the brand’s transition away from Shopify and toward a **wellness-first focus**.  

The relaunch experience emphasizes internal health, intentional self-care, and a curated return of select skincare essentials, while the storefront represents the brand’s evolving long-term digital presence.

This project is deployed via **GitHub Pages** and serves as a high-polish, campaign-style entry point designed to capture early interest ahead of the full storefront expansion.

## 🧭 Project Structure & Intent

This project is intentionally separated into two related but distinct experiences:

- **Storefront (`deeperthanskin-storefront`)**  
  The primary public-facing site representing the brand’s ongoing digital presence.

- **Relaunch Landing Page (`deeperthanskin-relaunch`)**  
  A time-bound, conversion-focused microsite used for:
  - Early access signups  
  - Brand repositioning  
  - Pre-launch engagement  
  - Campaign-driven traffic  

This separation allows the relaunch experience to be retired or evolved independently without disrupting the core storefront.
